# Managing your Research Data: Best practices in Research Data Management for Biological Sciences

- Monday 7th November 2022; 10:00-16:30; ONLINE using Crik-Marshall ZOOMed environment

## Outline

It has been said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. Not only does this represent a significant time investment for the data analyst, but is often a hurdle for the non-specialist trying to get to grips with analysing their own data after attending an R or Python course. Despite the best intentions, a spreadsheet that is intuitive and easily-understandable by human eyes can lead to disaster when trying to process computationally.

This workshop will go through the basic principles that we can all adopt in order to work with data more effectively and “think like a computer”. Moreover, we will discuss the best practices for data management and organisation so that our research is auditable and reproducible by ourselves, and others, in the future. Part of the journey will be via critical evaluation of example Data Management Plans (Often a condition of Grant).   

## Description
<Details>
  <Summary>Click here to expand</Summary>
  <ul>
    <li> - Do you know what a Data Management Plan is and what it covers?  </li> 
    <li> - How much data would you lose if your laptop was stolen?    </li>
    <li> - Have you ever emailed your colleague a file named 'final_final_versionEDITED'?  </li> 
    <li> - Have you ever struggled to import your spreadsheets into R?  </li> 
  </ul>
As a researcher, you will encounter research data in many forms, ranging from measurements, numbers and images to documents and publications. Whether you create, receive or collect data, you will certainly need to organise it at some stage of your project. This workshop will provide an overview of some basic principles on how we can work with data more effectively. We will discuss the best practices for research data management and organisation so that our research is auditable and reproducible by ourselves, and others, in the future.
