### Guidance to MYRD trainers

_Overall theme_
* Teach good practice
* Point to further, fuller guidance
* Try to relate principles by your experiences
* Encourage critical analysis of DMPs, reporting back/presentation skills, team working

_Session hints_
1. 	Introduction, Data Management Plans    
    * Introduce class to aims of class (Introduce tutors)
    * Check that their computers are loaded with s/w & materials
    (In Clinical School - show them how to login e.g. for usernme substitute xx for monitor label e.g. D3)
    (Virtual classroom - check that they've followed Pauls instructions and logged into the Openrefine VMs)
    * Cover the Why and what of Data Management forms & importance like Expt. Design & Statistical analysis.    
2.	Data formatting    
      Are Spreadsheets evil & how do you make them less so (validation)?   
      The Gibbs rules of data formatting:       
      Rule 1 -Never work directly on the raw data      
      Rule 2 - Maintain consistency.   
      Rule 3 - Don't use 0 to mean missing.   
      Rule 4 - Fill in all the cells.   
      Rule 5 - Make it rectangular.   
3.	OpenRefine practical (Live coding).  
    The example data file has many typical data entry errors use OR as an example tool to fix them (reassure 
    that all is not lost!).
    Relate what OR does in complying with our principles on data formatting.
4.	File management.  
    Get across principles of organising files in sub-dirs according to role e.g. figs/plots, data, logs etc.
    File naming - what is a good idea?
5.	File management in DMP practical    
    Building on what we learnt in the previous session class groups search example DMPs for instances
    of good practice & form opinions as to whether these are adequate. Make notes in Google Doc and brief report
    back.    
6.	Data Sharing & Backup     
    Different types of backup - extra disk, usb stick, archive, cloud all with pros & cons
    Duty to share findings (often required by journals)  - suitable repositories.   
7.	Data Sharing & Backup in DMP practical.   
    Building on what we learnt in the previous session class groups search example DMPs for instances
    of good practice & form opinions as to whether these are adequate. Make notes in Google Doc and brief report
    back.
8.	Wrap-up & close
   Recap on the principles taught today. Point them to further resources. Remind them about feedback survey.      
   
_Class organisation_.   
* In E-learning suite we spread class about the tables (6 per table) and in all but OR practical work as teams.   
* In Zoom Paul creates breakout rooms (Hope to swap people around in each practical).     

_The example DMPs_.  
Have been chosen to give a bit of variety to reflect their nature plus a less biology-focussed one for non-biology students.   
Also to show requirements in forms from different funders.   
Drosophila BBSRC project.                                         
Signalling pathways MRC project.
Bioinformatics software BBSRC project.                   * different one as deals with research software.                                                 
Pathways to violence & crime ESRC project.               * A less biological one for non-biologists who may attend.  
Horizon 2020 EU Project.                                 * An uberDMP â€“ Extra-long as EU love their paperwork.
