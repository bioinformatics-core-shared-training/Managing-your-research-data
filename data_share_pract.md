## Data Sharing practical

__Working as a group on your table, please either:__     
a) examine the example DMPs     
   or.   
b) If someone has their own project data example. Note that you should still.   
take a quick look at one of the DMPs to guide you.      

For the above, note what you deem to be or derive examples of good Data Sharing     
principles as referred to in the previous talk. What are your opinions of how     
these are documented/which principles did you apply to your data?      

We will have a 5 minute session at end of practical to share findings.
