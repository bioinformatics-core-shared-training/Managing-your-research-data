## Data Sharing practical

__Working as a group__.     

Re-examine the example DMPs, maybe pick a different one to you read before.
     
Note what you deem to be or derive examples of good data sharing principles
as referred to in the previous talk. 

What are your opinions of how these are documented/which principles did you
apply to your data?      

You may want to use the [DMP checklist](DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf).

We will have a 5 minute session at end of practical to share findings.
