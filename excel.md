## Excel Validation practical
A new experimental trial is being carried out with a new drug that treats arthritis. Half of the patients will be treated with the drug and half with a placebo.   
_Data will be recorded as follows:_   
Patients name (text), ID number(Alphanumeric), Placebo (Y/N), Movement score(Physician assessed on scale 1-5),
Pain score (patient assessed on scale 0-5), inflammation (Y/N).   
### Task
Create a new excel spreadsheet with the following columns:
Firstname, Lastname,IDno,Placebo,Movescore,Painscore,Inflammation
Use the data validation feature to ensure that all fields are filled in with the correct range/type of data. Is it possible to ensure that cells are not left blank?  
Give helpful feedback messages if data is input incorrectly.    

Test your sheet by entering some made-up data (better yet swap with your neighbour & test each others spreadsheets).
