## Spreadsheet Validation practical
A new experimental trial is being carried out with a new drug that treats arthritis. Half of the patients will be treated with the drug and half with a placebo.   
_Data will be recorded as follows:_   
Patients first & last name (text), ID number(Alphanumeric), Placebo (Y/N), Movement score(Physician assessed on scale 1-5),
Pain score (patient assessed on scale 0-5), inflammation (None/Low/Medium/High).   
### Task
Create a new spreadsheet (e.g. with Excel or Libre/OpenOffice or GoogleSheets**) with the following columns:    
Firstname, Lastname,IDno,Placebo,Movescore,Painscore,Inflammation.   
Use the data validation feature to ensure that all fields are filled in with the correct range/type of data. Is it possible to ensure that cells are not left blank?     
If you want to try out Date validation, just add another column for an Assessment date.

Give helpful feedback messages if data is input incorrectly.       

Test your sheet by entering some made-up data (better yet swap with your neighbour & test each others spreadsheets). 
Can you break your sheet? (NB if you can then so can others!).    

** You can log into Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/). If you do not have a Google account you should be able to use your CRSID and then be logged in via Raven.    

__Hint section__.   
In __Open/LibreOffice__ use the Data-Validity option (NB to avoid empty cells change from all values to anything else. You will then be able to de-select the allow empty cells box. Then click on the desired data type.    
In __Excel__ Use the Data-Validation option.   
In. __GoogleSheets__ Use the Data-Validation option. NB GS seems to have less functionality compared to Excel and LibreOffice.
