## File Management practical

__Working as a group__.   

Select one of the Data Management Plans and examine it.

For the above, note what you deem to be examples of good File Management     
principles as referred to in the previous talk.     

You may want to use the [DMP checklist](DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf).

What are your opinions of how these DMPs are documented?

What management practices/which principles are to be implented?

Is there anything they have missed or omitted?         

We will have a 5 minute session at end of practical to share findings.
